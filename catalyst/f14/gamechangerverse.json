                "solution": "# **The problem:**\nAre Cardano DApps Truly Decentralized?\n\nCardano takes a unique approach to DApps by offloading certain parts of their execution and storage off-chain. This strategy enhances performance and reliability compared to solutions like EVM chains. However, this design introduces a critical flaw—one that has become more pronounced with the adoption of the CIP-30 standard.\n\nThe off-chain components of Cardano DApps currently rely on centralized cloud infrastructures. Their source code and application data are not stored in a decentralized, long-term, fail-proof, and censorship-resistant solution.\n\nWhile great projects like Iagon aim to address some of these challenges and more, they still fall short of offering mission-critical solutions for Cardano. Like IPFS and other decentralized storage solutions, they store data outside the Cardano network itself, which can create single points of failure and data loss due to potential global outages, team challenges, or platform security breaches.\n\nFor mission-critical Cardano applications—and even minimal, essential versions of any Cardano app—the only reliable solution is to rely on Cardano itself. This is the only path to a truly decentralized, fault-tolerant, and censorship-resistant infrastructure.\n\nCurrently, terabytes of on-chain transaction metadata are being generated by apps and users. Yet, there’s no coherent strategy for indexing and searching this data. A system that can organize this &quot;chaos&quot; and treat it like searchable files would be invaluable for developers and users alike. Such a solution could also optimize the use of precious on-chain storage, reducing redundancy and potentially introducing compression features.\n\nSince April 1st, 2023, Cardano has had GCFS—a fully on-chain file storage solution that has proven itself capable of hosting not only DApp off-chain code but also on-chain source code. It can even support minimal, cost-effective frontends, helping create a censorship-resistant, fault-tolerant Cardano ecosystem. This would position Cardano to remain competitive against other chains, like EVM, that have already embraced fully self-contained DApps with long-term viability, even in worst-case scenarios.\n\nThe CIP-30 wallet standard, inspired by MetaMask’s design, encourages the offloading of even more DApp code outside of decentralized storage and execution. This approach does little to foster open-source collaboration or DApp/protocol interoperability, limiting Cardano's potential.\n\nJust two weeks after Nami Wallet introduced the CIP-30 standard, GameChanger Wallet proposed an alternative approach. This Universal DApp Connector specification is designed specifically for UTXO-based blockchains like Cardano and moves away from the &quot;MetaMask model&quot; that works better for Ethereum. This alternative allows critical parts of DApp execution to happen on the client side, running directly on user devices. This increases decentralization by putting control into users’ hands, ensuring transparency, and creating an environment ripe for open-source collaboration.\n\nThe key to this system is GCScript, a simple language built on universal building blocks like JSON, common across platforms and languages. GCScript is to Cardano somewhat Solidity is to Ethereum, but it preserves underlying Cardano’s deterministic nature.\n\nGCScript integrates seamlessly with GCFS, empowering developers to store reusable source code on-chain. This not only ensures that DApps are auditable, decentralized, fault-tolerant, and censorship-resistant but also encourages developers to collaborate, fostering an unprecedented explosion of open-source, decentralized DApps on Cardano.\n\nGCFS development began in 2022 out of proposer’s funds and development efforts and remains unfunded and unsupported by Cardano, this is our 3rd and last attempt to release it to the community .\n\nGCFS is currently implemented on GameChanger Wallet and some tooling demos:\n\n- on GCScript language, 4 functions available for developers to build dapps with it\n- through the GCFS File Uploader UI at Playground IDE\n- on a GCFS web server demo for Catalyst\n\n# **The Solution:**\nWe will rewrite, improve and open source GCFS as a typescript library for allowing applications to read and search for files stored on-chain, and we will include a GCFS web server rewritten from grown up as a proper implementation example to serve files including HTML for fully on-chain hosted frontends as you can try out through our MVP demo GCFS web server published here:\n\n**Announcement of the Demo:** [https://x\\.com/GameChangerOk/status/1834062592060322161](https://x.com/GameChangerOk/status/1834062592060322161)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger.wallet/refs/heads/main/catalyst/img/fund14/dapp.png)\n\n**Image**: A dapp 100% stored on-chain, yes, even the html file\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger.wallet/refs/heads/main/catalyst/img/fund14/index.png)\n\n**Image**: Directory index of a user's on-chain file system\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger.wallet/refs/heads/main/catalyst/img/fund14/proof.png)\n\n**Image**: One of the first files ever written on chain.\n\nGCFS allows for running filtered searches across all file systems stored on-chain allowing developers not only to store files but also to use them as a global database for dapps, fostering a grand variety of applications, from voting to social media, to oracles and fully on-chain open and universal protocols. As you can try yourself on the demo, the web server will allow to run queries to build this kind of applications.\n\nA directory index rendered on backend-side will help users, and developers, to understand the structure of on-chain file systems and to seamlessly explore them as if one were navigating the web.\n\n# Please check our other Fund14 proposals [here]([https://github\\.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger\\.wallet/blob/main/catalyst/FUND14\\.md\\)](https://github.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger.wallet/blob/main/catalyst/FUND14.md))"

But it has a lot of limitations. We have been building dApps for a while now. Great examples are [https://www\\.adamoments\\.io/](https://www.adamoments.io/) and [https://arpradio\\.media/\\.](https://arpradio.media/.) The libary could really do with a major overhaul. Where we integrate all that knowledge into usefull functions any web developer can use.\n\n# **Make the GC library work well with the latest nodeJS releases\\.**\nThe Javascript ecosystem moves fast. The library could do with an update. Making it much easier to integrate into the latest and greatest.\n\n# **Integrate gc\\-connect**\nA must have feature for any dApp is the abbility to verify and remember the users wallet. This component takes signing in a step further. Combining it with webtokens to make interfering with a users session that extra step harder. It is already working in dApps. Adding it here will make it easy to use for everyone. [https://github\\.com/arpradio/gc\\-connect](https://github.com/arpradio/gc-connect)\n\n# Integrate smart contract in-browser user-side compilation\nWith inception we built a smart contract dApp. This allows the user to compile contracts from source. Verify its validty and the execute it using the Gamechanger wallet. All you need is a browser. So we will add transpilation features of [https://inception\\.m2tec\\.nl/](https://inception.m2tec.nl/) to this libary.\n\n# Unimatrix helper functions\nThis technology alreay leveraged by [https://www\\.adamoments\\.io/](https://www.adamoments.io/) with great effect. An essential feature for any DAO that needs to work with multisig wallets and async transaction signing. Even for a single transaction this has benefits for the dApp. Because it can monitor transaction progress and make the user experience more interactive.\n\n# Template\nMake a dApp template that is easy to setup and deploy"

                "solution": "# Cardano Graph:\nEvery mature blockchain ecosystem counts with an active flagship GraphQL API to ease development and allow for faster development iteration and prototyping, to minimize centralization by avoid forcing developers to build their own custom backend solutions and to empower more client side development by keeping backends open sourced and general purposed.\n\nThe GraphQL API specification allows for nesting API schemas and even cross relate them to allow developers to design their desired data queries by filtering and nesting responses, all on a single client-server communication (HTTP request).\n\nCardano is missing the API of APIs, a well-known, battle-tested, unified query language to make developer's life easier without forcing everybody to reinvent the wheel with novel or narrow-scoped API specifications.\n\nBy leveraging on GraphQL composabiity and extensibility is that we will provide a base server structure allowing for API extensions, all under the same query language: GraphQL.\n\nAlso this service will be designed to be deployed on Dandelion Lite in first place, a Cardano Node and APIs self sovereign deployment solution for decentralizing Cardano services and for empowering students and developers. ARP Radio, AdaMoments and GameChanger Wallet already use it.\n\n# Cardano-GraphQL:\nWas the most powerfull API back in the day making possible many of the legacy projects and exchange integrations around us.\n\nIn principle will be based on the legacy open source project created by IOHK and maintained by Cardano Foundation, specially regarding schema design to leverage on the 4+ year project with their mature experience, and also to be able to absorve their updates and mutually collaborate on improvements.\n\nOur approach for this will be to offer almost the same API endpoints but with some implementation differences and a totally different, modern and optimized GraphQL introspection engine underneath.\n\nThis will allow us to offer the same solution but in a single instance with chances of reusing some recurrent tasks and database tables from other open source API projects also operating over a Cardano DBSync database. Our goal will be to make it easy to maintain to maximize open source collaboration.\n\nEngine optimizations will allow to solve problems like the N+1 fetch issues, a common GraphQL performance failure where the same database information is fetched more than once on same query. Other improvements will be around schema design, optimizing when possible queries involving off-chain token registry, on-chain assets and address balances.\n\nIs important to keep in mind that we cannot promise this to be a drop-in replacement of the former API implementation, but if this is something technically possible to be achieved we will try to do so, otherwise we will try to narrow down differences at a reasonable level.\n\n# BlockFrost-GQL:\nA basic extension will allow for OpenAPI's compliant REST APIs to be included as a sub-schema, making for example BlockFrost available by using the GraphQL query language.\n\nThis will reduce the roundtrips and optimize the timings and reliability for calling several endpoints from client side as this powerfull solution will allow you to pack them under a single http request. Potencially in the future server responses could be nested by relating schemas, empowering BlockFrost users to design flexible queries with ease. Also other great projects like 'Koios-GQL' could be added as well, specially considering Dandelion Lite is already based on Koios solutions.\n\n# YaCi-GQL:\nA basic smart and adaptive extension will allow for the YaCi Dev Kit Postgres database to be exposed via GraphQL. This will serve as first steps to offer an entire new alternative to Cardano GraphQL by leveraging on Cardano Foundation's YaCI Dev Kit instead of IOG's Cardano DBSync.\n\n**Scope:**\n\nRegarding the scope of this solution, Cardano-GraphQL extension API in working state will be delivered, with Cardano Graph, BlockFrost-GQL and Yaci-GQL and any other extra priorization being conditioned by budget constraints as ADA fluctuations are expected to take place in the near term. We will prioritize goals based on project demand and budget constraints, we have a solid 10+ Catalyst projects delivery record with good value for money ratio, as always we will deliver our best.\n\n**Examples**:\n\nHere there are some example queries from our proof of concept aimed for a new Cardano-GraphQL implementation. As you can see, similar queries can be provided but not exactly a drop in replacement, still adding performance and design improvements.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger.wallet/refs/heads/main/catalyst/img/fund14/query1.jpg)![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger.wallet/refs/heads/main/catalyst/img/fund14/query2.jpg)\n\n\n\n# Please check our other Fund14 proposals [here]([https://github\\.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger\\.wallet/blob/main/catalyst/FUND14\\.md\\)](https://github.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger.wallet/blob/main/catalyst/FUND14.md))"

Update your client side only as what your backend already provides is more than enough already.\n- Online IDE + Self-Documented: GraphQL schemas can be explored, queries can be designed on code editors that are provided out of the box.\n- Less backend-side centralization: universal, general purpose, fully-featured open source APIs does not incentivize for custom centralized backend solutions on every project we build on Cardano\n- Decentralization-friendly backends: general purpose, flexible common backend solutions for every client side project to consume vs siloed, specialized, closed source solutions nobody is interested in re-deploy for better redundancy and dec.ntralization."
