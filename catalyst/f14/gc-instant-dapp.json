But it has a lot of limitations. We have been building dApps for a while now. Great examples are [https://www\\.adamoments\\.io/](https://www.adamoments.io/) and [https://arpradio\\.media/\\.](https://arpradio.media/.) The libary could really do with a major overhaul. Where we integrate all that knowledge into usefull functions any web developer can use.\n\n# **Make the GC library work well with the latest nodeJS releases\\.**\nThe Javascript ecosystem moves fast. The library could do with an update. Making it much easier to integrate into the latest and greatest.\n\n# **Integrate gc\\-connect**\nA must have feature for any dApp is the abbility to verify and remember the users wallet. This component takes signing in a step further. Combining it with webtokens to make interfering with a users session that extra step harder. It is already working in dApps. Adding it here will make it easy to use for everyone. [https://github\\.com/arpradio/gc\\-connect](https://github.com/arpradio/gc-connect)\n\n# Integrate smart contract in-browser user-side compilation\nWith inception we built a smart contract dApp. This allows the user to compile contracts from source. Verify its validty and the execute it using the Gamechanger wallet. All you need is a browser. So we will add transpilation features of [https://inception\\.m2tec\\.nl/](https://inception.m2tec.nl/) to this libary.\n\n# Unimatrix helper functions\nThis technology alreay leveraged by [https://www\\.adamoments\\.io/](https://www.adamoments.io/) with great effect. An essential feature for any DAO that needs to work with multisig wallets and async transaction signing. Even for a single transaction this has benefits for the dApp. Because it can monitor transaction progress and make the user experience more interactive.\n\n# Template\nMake a dApp template that is easy to setup and deploy"

Through the first dApps like Adamoments([https://www\\.adamoments\\.io/\\)](https://www.adamoments.io/)) and Arpradio ([https://arpradio\\.media/\\)](https://arpradio.media/)) Gamechanger is already showing that it can make building rich interactive dApps a reality. With this proposal we take the next step, reducing developer workload, end greatly improving time to market. Combining all the knowledge and technology into a single place. It will propel the ecosystem to new hights."

We also built Dandelion-lite ([https://github\\.com/GameChangerFinance/dandelion\\-lite\\)\\)](https://github.com/GameChangerFinance/dandelion-lite))) to make truly decentralized financial infrastructure a reality. We have gained a lot of experience in all aspects of Cardano developement.\n\nWe have also participated in a number of Catalyst Funds where we have won and executed on our promises. This indicates our proven track record of delivering. We are here to build the future of finance and are commited for the long term.\n\n# Feasability\nAs descibed in our solution in detail we are aggregating and polishing components that have already been built.
