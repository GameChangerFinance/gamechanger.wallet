## [GameChanger: Open sourcing GCFS to put dapps FULLY on-chain, not in centralized nor external infrastructure](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/cardano/idea/126932)

**Problem:** Current Cardano DApps rely on centralized and external infrastructures for off-chain data, code storage and execution, introducing single points of failure and limiting true decentralization

**Solution:** Improve and open-source GCFS as a TypeScript library for reading and searching files stored on-chain, and a web server that can even serve HTML for frontends, supporting fully on-chain resilient DApps

## [Dandelion-lite: Decentralized nodes for dummies for GameChanger, Gimbalabs, Roundtable and devs](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/cardano/idea/126975)

**Problem:** Cardano dApps rely on centralized API infrastructure introducing points of failure, prone to censorship, encouraging close source development and limiting true decentralization.

**Solution:** Decentralize dApps and services, support developers , students and educate, all with a Docker-compose and Podman based project of popular open-source APIs that can be "started with 1 click"

## [Project Catapult: Where not-funded and finished proposals are not left behind - by GameChanger Finance ❤️](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/cardano/idea/131265)

**Problem:** Most of the EPIC community efforts done by Catalyst Team, Reviewers, Voters, and specially Proposers after each Catalyst Fund goes to waste. Many not-funded projects get stalled. Even this one.

**Solution:** Let's facilitate for the community to save any project, also Catalyst-curated not-funded projects, by catapulting them forward with donations and other mechanisms. Second chances, even for this dapp.
