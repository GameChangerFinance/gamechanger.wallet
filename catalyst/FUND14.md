## [GameChanger: On-Chain File Storage on Cardano (GCFS)](https://app.projectcatalyst.io/proposal/0198a8f0-f106-75eb-b46c-376efea6dbd0)

**Problem:** Current Cardano governance and dApps rely on centralized and external infrastructure for off-chain file, data and code storage, introducing single points of failure and limiting decentralization

**Solution:** Rewrite and open-source GCFS as a TypeScript library for reading and searching files stored on-chain, and a web server that can even serve HTML for frontends, supporting fully on-chain resilient DApps

## [GameChanger: Instant dApp, build for any device fast](https://app.projectcatalyst.io/proposal/019889e0-2645-77ba-87c2-b03d855d048f)

**Problem:** Building on Cardano often requires deep knowledge and the skill. With GameChanger Wallet we want to take a different approach. We want to make writing dApps the domain of every web developer out there.

**Solution:** GamaChanger Wallet is made for rapid application developement. We are going to make it even better. Packing all our experience into a JS library that will make writing dApps easy for everyone"

## [Dandelion: new CardanoGraphQL+Blockfrost+Yaci over GraphQL](https://app.projectcatalyst.io/proposal/0198a39e-2f9d-796a-8750-2d267d626484)

**Problem:** Cardano GraphQL allows for custom queries and less API calls. With network growth it's performance and maintainance became a problem. We want to offer a modern redesign as devs and students needs it.

**Solution:** A single GraphQL API for all things Cardano: Blockfrost, YaCi and a modern, simpler and maintainance-friendly redesign of Cardano GraphQL API"
