## [GameChanger: On-Chain File Storage on Cardano (GCFS)](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/cardano/idea/126932)

**Problem:** Current Cardano governance and dApps rely on centralized and external infrastructure for off-chain file, data and code storage, introducing single points of failure and limiting decentralization

**Solution:** Rewrite and open-source GCFS as a TypeScript library for reading and searching files stored on-chain, and a web server that can even serve HTML for frontends, supporting fully on-chain resilient DApps

## [Dandelion: new CardanoGraphQL+Blockfrost+Yaci over GraphQL]()

**Problem:** Cardano GraphQL allows for custom queries and less API calls. With network growth it's performance and maintainance became a problem. We want to offer a modern redesign as devs and students needs it.

**Solution:** A single GraphQL API for all things Cardano: Blockfrost, YaCi and a modern, simpler and maintainance-friendly redesign of Cardano GraphQL API"
